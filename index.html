            Hey There!! , I take it you already know my name cause you won't be
            bothered with the boring part. Yesss!! ik my name is not that good,
            Prajwal P, Wow just can't get worse than this. At the end of the day
            no matter how good looking you are or how many abs you have, it
            doesn't matter if your name isn't cool. Not to make this a boring
            sadistic about me page, I would like to tell some good things about
            myself, as you've already heard I'm super good looking and have some
            abs.. hehe one actually lel. Sooo... I'm a mechanical engineer
            graduated from this college called NITTE. I took up mech cause I was
            too stupid. After completing mech, I realized I'm not studip!! am I?
            I have this crazy interest in CS, crazier than your GF or BF
            depending on who is reading this, or if it's Rajath, Bro! get a life
            there is nothing crazy about your life. Just to be serious for a
            minute I actually feel I can have a real good future in this field I
            have spoken enough about myself, tell me something about
            yourself......(waiting) hahahahahhhahhahahahahahhh ik I'm too funny
            also right?. Add this to the list of crazy things you noted down
            about me. Autographs later by the way, Just kidding!..........I
            don't give autographs for free (insert demon face emoji). So I'd
            like to tell you all a small story about this friend of mine who
            actually knowingly or unknowingly changed my life. Thanks to him I
            can now actually do something that I want rather than something that
            someone else wants's me to do. I'm not gonna mention his name cause
            he might not want me to do so. Ok fine!! I have mentioned him
            earlier already, Rajath (insert "don't kill me for this Rajath"
            emoji). Rajath is undoubtedly the ugliest guys you will ever
            meet..... on a sewage construction site in India. Just kidding, He's
            worse than that. Hehe, He is good looking actually I just like to
            make fun of his face as all friends do. Let's ignore his face for a
            moment (Like ever girl does), Just consider him as a 7 of 100. He
            used to like this girl in the first year. Let's just call her cute
            girl for now. So cute girl is crazy cute right trust me. You might
            also ask why I didn't fall for this cute girl. That's simply cause I
            have higher standards than Rajath (Let's just take a moment of
            silence for Rajath to Recover from that insane burn) lol. He had a
            crush on this cute girl since 1st year of engineering. One of my
            friends tried to set him up with the cute girl. This cute girl (not
            sure if she wanted to be his friend or was just forced to do it)
            comes to him after class, to say Hi!!. This good for nothing dummo
            sees her coming toward him and runs away. She felt so awkward and
            started ignoring him (like other girls (I should stop doing this)).
            2nd year Engineering, She is now in a relationship with some guy,
            not even close to looking like Rajath (Yess! There are people way
            uglier than Rajath, even I was shocked to see that guy). She is a
            sweet person and might have liked him for his character not gonna
            comment anything (But, talk about standards lol). 3rd year, They
            broke up! Yesss finally something good happening in Rajath's life.
            Now is his chance to 'Make his move', That's exactly what I told him
            too. But he doesn't do anything, decides to just have a crush on
            her. His theory is "I will meet her in Bangalore metro one day, she
            will come to me and we'll start dating" (as if that's ever gonna
            happen). 4th year, Nothing much happens as he doesn't act on it,
            even if we had forced him to do so. Sticks to his metro theory
            Engineering is done!, Here comes the bomb, She posts a status on
            facebook which says Happily Engaged with a picture of herself and
            her fiance. Again, Not gonna comment on her standards (insert vomit
            face emoji). hehe. It's over now! Rajath can't ever try for the cute
            girl, nor will she meet and ask him out on a metro. Even if he does
            meet her in the metro, it'll be with her husband, she will always
            remember him as The guy who ran when I came to meet him. He can only
            hope for her to not get married, if he does like her still (which I
            think he does). I told Rajath about the bomb the cute girl dropped.
            He said I was planning to date her daughter, as awkward as that
            sounds I was actually shocked that he did not burst out in tears.
            What's the moral of this story? apart from the fact that Rajath's
            only partner is bad luck. Here's something about me, I never liked
            being in Mechanical engineering. Not that it was boring, it was
            kinda interesting actually. But what's the point of doing something
            that you don't like, especially when you like something else. I
            always wanted to do something in Computer Science, when asked as a
            child What do you wanna be when you grow up? I'd say I'll be a
            Software Engineer even if, at that point, I did not know what that
            meant. Now I know what it means, I know what I want and unlike
            Rajath I won't let what I want to pass, Not anymore. Here's the real
            moral of the story, Not just this story but also every story out
            there - You won't ever get what you want unless you give it a try.
            "Jibun ga daiji ni surubeki koto... Sore ga wakaranakereba, jinsei
            nante ate no nai tabi damono." If you don't know what you should
            hold dear, then your life is just a journey without a destination.
